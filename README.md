# About

This dashboard was developed to showcase a number of awesome features of R (and by definition, other programming languages used in data analysis today). Many people still think programming is used by developers to build systems and is out of reach of everyone else, but with this dashboard we'd like to show non-programmers how empowering, versatile and fun it can be to learn tools like R or Python.

The dashboard was developed for Chemistry Honours students in South Africa hence the focus on the periodic table. Of course this dashboard is also accessible to learners in high school who have learned about the periodic table.

We hope this resource will inspire and assist others to build more accessible lessons around R (or other programming languages and data tools such as OpenRefine, FrictionlessData, and more).
